. (All students) Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group. o This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion does not need to follow the design of the main website.}
