**Assessment regulations**

Refer to section 4 of the “How you study” guide for undergraduate students for a clarification of how you are
assessed, penalties and late submissions, what constitutes plagiarism etc.

**Penalty for Late Submission**


If you submit your coursework late but within 24 hours or one working day of the specified deadline, 10 marks
will be deducted from the final mark, as a penalty for late submission, except for work which obtains a mark in
the range 40 – 49%, in which case the mark will be capped at the pass mark (40%). If you submit your coursework
more than 24 hours or more than one working day after the specified deadline you will be given a mark of zero
for the work in question unless a claim of Mitigating Circumstances has been submitted and accepted as valid.

It is recognised that on occasion, illness or a personal crisis can mean that you fail to submit a piece of work on
time. In such cases you must inform the Campus Office in writing on a mitigating circumstances form, giving the
reason for your late or non-submission. You must provide relevant documentary evidence with the form. This
information will be reported to the relevant Assessment Board that will decide whether the mark of zero shall
stand. For more detailed information regarding University Assessment Regulations, please refer to the following
website: **[http://www.westminster.ac.uk/study/current-students/resources/academic-regulations](http://www.westminster.ac.uk/study/current-students/resources/academic-regulations)**

## Coursework Description

```
Work in groups of 4 students (all group members should be from the same Web Design and
Development tutorial group). Prepare a Web site about a subject of your choice (please see at the
bottom of the page for a list of possible subjects). You have to ensure that your site complies with
the Janet regulations on publications of web pages (see under Blackboard link to Assessment
Details).
```
## Part A

```
This Web site should include:
```
1. (Student 1) A presentation page with title and the name of everyone in the group. After 4
    seconds, a second page will be displayed (Main Web page).
2. (Student 2) Your Main page should be designed so that the user can access several parts of
    the site. The links on your main page should look like buttons and have a hover effect. This
    should be created using CSS.
3. (Student 1) Use JavaScript to create the functionality to increase / decrease the font size
    used on the website. The basic functionality should include two buttons - a button to make
    the font size smaller and a button to make the font size larger (half allocated marks).
    Advanced functionality will allow for the font size to increase in steps up and down (full
    allocated marks).
4. (Student 2) Your site should contain a form to send comments about your web site. This
    form should include:
       o input fields for users to enter their details (name, email address)
       o a field to enter comments
       o a way to rate your web site (using radio buttons or select)
       o Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the compulsory fields -
          'name' and 'rating'. Do NOT use HTML5 validation for this part.
       o If the name and ratings are filled-in, the user should get an HTML popup window
          with the summary including the name, any comments and rating given on the
          form.
          For example, if the user entered "John" for their name, rated the site as "good" and
          entered "Very informative website", the popup window should say something like:
          "Dear John, Thank you very much for your feedback. You have rated our site
          as **Good** and your comment was **Very informative website** ."
5. (Student 1) Your site should contain a form to allow people to buy products related to the
    topic of your web site, i.e. if your topic is football, you could be selling football shirts,
    accessories, etc. This should include:
       o personal details;
       o at least 3 different products to choose from;
       o number of items for each product;
       o automatically provide the total price of the bill.


```
o Use JavaScript validation to check that the user has filled-in the following
compulsory fields - personal details, product and number of items. Do NOT use
HTML5 validation for this part.
o If the compulsory fields are filled-in, when the 'place order' button is clicked, the
user should get a popup window with the summary of the order. For example, the
text in the popup window could be something like: "Dear John, you have ordered 2
T-shirts size M at a cost of £20 each and a pair of trainers at a cost of £50. Your
total bill is £90."
```
6. (Student 4) Your site should contain a sitemap. The sitemap should have navigation links to
    the appropriate part of the group website, and should be developed in SVG.
7. (Student 3) Your site should contain an interactive multiple choice quiz about the subject
    you are developing on your Web site. Once the quiz has been completed, it gives the user a
    mark on how he/she performed. This should be time limited. When the quiz is finished
    should also display the summary of the user performance (which answers were correct or
    incorrect, and how long it took to complete the quiz). The user will get 2 marks for each
    correct answer, and -1 for each wrong answer. The quiz should consist of 10 questions. The
    background colour of the page should change according to the awarded mark.
8. (Student 4) Create a page that allows the user to view images. This page contains a form, 5
    thumbnail images, and 2 pull-down menus (to select the page background colour and the
    page text colour) and an area to display a larger image and associated description of that
    image. When the user selects a thumbnail image, the corresponding large image and the
    description of that image should display in the defined location on the form. You may use
    onMouseOver or radio buttons to select the thumbnail.
9. (Student 3) Your main page should contain four pictures of the members of the group.
    When the user moves the mouse over one picture, the details of that member should be
    displayed in an area on the page (for example, you could use a div below the pictures). The
    details should include the name and role that that student took for the coursework (e.g.
    John Smith, Student 1).
10. Consistency of style should be ensured using
    a. a unique external style sheet file main page and navigation(Student 2)
    b. used throughout the web site (all students)
11. (All students) Your site should contain a link to a CV for each member of your group.
    o This should be a complete CV (written in html) similar to one you would present to
       a potential employer. Your CV should have your picture at the top right hand-side
       corner. This page is external to the group website and therefore on this occasion
       does not need to follow the design of the main website.
12. (All students) Any page longer than the screen size should have links to various parts of the
    text at the top of the page.
13. (All students) Each page should include your title logo at the top, and a link to the page
    editor (the person who wrote the page) at the bottom of the page. (E.g., here you could
    make a link to the CV of the person who created that page).
14. (All students) Feel free to use additional JavaScript to add interactivity and increase ease of
    navigation.

## Part B

Further details will be released in Semester Two.

**Demonstration**
You will have to give a compulsory live demo of your Web site in your tutorial class (see schedule).

**Report**
Each student should submit an **individual** report to Blackboard. Further details will be released n
